            <p>
               Getting a good work out really makes a huge difference in my day. It makes me feel better mentally and physically. It gives me a sense of accomplishment and boosts my self-confindence. There's just always been one issue. I HATE GYMS. 
                Gyms have always felt crowded, smelly, and I have no idea what any of that equipment does. I have a Rocky II training mentality. I will not go lift weights in front of a wall to wall mirror, but I will go chop wood for hours. I needed a task
                that also provided me with a sense of community and fun with the added benefit of a good workout. This is how I found myself in the rock climbing community. A hobby/sport practiced by some of the most humble, kind, and down-to-earth (pun-intended) people you'll
                ever meet. I'm no expert by any means, but I am an evangelist. Below I will share some of the things I have learned and experienced. Maybe you'll love it, maybe you'll hate it, but you won't know until you give it a try yourself.

                        * Good shoes are a really important piece of equipment to a climber. They are a second skin meant to protect you and aid you in more difficult climbs. Second skin = tight. Uncomfortable but not painful is the rule of thumb. You want those piggies at the very end of your shoe which gives you more control. My favorite beginner shoe is the La Sportiva Tarantulace.

                    <h3>
                        Now that you're geared up, it's time to TIE-IN!
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        To "tie-in" is simply attaching the climbing end of the rope to your harness loop but using a figure eight knot. This is really your first learning experience in climbing. It seems simple, but I can't understate the importance of a good knot. I learned with a silly snowman saying similar to the tried and true bunny rabbit ears when tying your shoes.
                    </p>
                    <ul type = "1" class="lists">
                        <li>Grasp the end of the rope with one hand and slide the alternate hand along the length of the rope, across your chest, stopping when you meet your shoulder </li>
                        <li>Next, pinch the two ropes together at the distance of your shouler. This is your Snowman head.</li>
                        <li>Falling from the head will be a short peice of rope and a very long peice of rope. We'll only be working with the short peice for the rest of the figure 8 knot.</li>
                        <li>Now, wrap the short rope around your snowman's head like a scarf.</li>
                        <li>Once you have wrapped the scarf all the way around, poke the end of your rope right in the middle of the snowman head like a carrot nose.</li>
                        <li>Pull the two ends to tighten and you should have a figure 8 knot!</li>
                        <li>Almost done! From the bottom up, pull the short end of your rope into your harness loops pulling the knot close to you. </li>
                        <li>Finally, take the short rope and feed it back into the knot, tracing the orginial as you go. Your end result should be a double figure 8 knot with two fists of length left at the end.</li>
                        This can admittedly be confusing, so I've attached a really helpful video provided by REI below.

                    <h3>
                        Now you're ready to CLIMB!
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Once you're geared up and tied in, your climbing partner, who must be a certified belayer, will feed the rope into a belay device. This acts as a brake on the climbing rope by applying friction and locks the rope if you slip or just need to dangle for a rest. You'll both check each others belay and knot to make sure everything is good to go. Now, throw some chalk on those hands and and start climbing! As you go up the wall, your belay partner will continue to remove the slack form your rope keeping it taught. 
                        As long as you've made sure all of your equipment is in proper working order and you are tied in correctly, trust your parnter and be brave. Some tips I've gathered when actually climbing are:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="lists">
                        <li>First, guide with your hands. Just like climbing a ladder, maintain three points of contact at all times, find an outstretched but compfortable hand hold.</li>
                        <li>Lift one leg to find a comfortable foot hold about knee to hip height making sure to use the tips of your toes as opposed to the sides of your feet. This affords you a lot for flexability when changing directions. </li>
                        <li>While keeping a firm grip on your hand holds, use the higher leg to simply push yourself up the wall.</li>
                        <li>Once you're leg is straight, find a good foot hold for that other leg and keep going until you reach the top!</li>
                        A common mistake beginners make in climbing is trying to pull themselves up a wall using their arms which tire much faster than legs. So, when you're up there, remember to make the legs do the majority of the work. It's much easier to just stand up than pull yourself up a wall speaking from experience.
